## Project Overview
<!-- [Provide a brief introduction to the project. What does it do? What problem does it solve?] -->

**Climate Options** is a Unity-based tool created to empower users in choosing climate control options for 
residential environments and obtaining precise cost estimates for their desired Climate Control System. With its 
intuitive features and real-world data integration, our tool enables individuals to make well-informed decisions 
about climate control systems, ensuring both comfort and energy efficiency while considering budgetary constraints. 
This release marks the culmination of the capstone course in the Bachelor of Computer Science program at Eastern 
Washington University. Although the project's scope is academic, it represents a noteworthy milestone in merging 
technology with sustainable living practices.

## Features
<!-- [List the key features or functionalities of the project.] -->
- Floor Plan Creation: The program provides a floor plan creation feature that allows users to define the number of rooms and bathrooms for their house. 
As an optional feature, users also have the flexibility to upload existing floor plans for reference or customization purposes.

- Component Selection and Customization: The program offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to effortlessly select and add various components to any area of their home. Users can explore a wide 
range of climate control options and easily customize their configurations by choosing specific components for each room.

- Detailed Component Information: To assist users in making informed decisions, the program provides comprehensive information about each component. Users can access details such as the pros, cons, and cost of a particular component.

- Utilizes Real-World Weather Data: The project harnesses real-world climate data for a specific location provided by the user. This information is used to generate accurate cost calculations based on the installed 
climate system components, expected operational needs, and ensures precise estimations tailored to the user's environment.

- Saving and Loading Configurations: The program provides a convenient feature for saving and loading configurations. This functionality allows users to compare and contrast different house setups, 
including room configurations and climate control choices. By easily revisiting and modifying their configurations, users can make informed decisions and fine-tune their climate control system to 
achieve the desired balance of comfort and efficiency.
