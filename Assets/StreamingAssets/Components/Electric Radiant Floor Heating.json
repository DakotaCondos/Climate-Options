{"componentName":"Electric Radiant Floor Heating","description":"Radiant floor systems come in several styles, but one of the most popular is the electric system, in which a wire mesh or loops of individual wires run across the floor beneath the surface, creating warmth by means of the natural resistance occurring as electricity flows through the metal wires.","pros":"Electric radiant heating systems buried within thermal masses (such as between cement board and ceramic tile) can retain heat for a long time, even after the power is turned off. They are easy to install during remodeling projects. Radiant systems, in general, are more cost-effective than other means of electric supplemental heating, such as space heaters. Lastly, Electric radiant floor systems offer a discreet way of heating a floor.","cons":"These systems are difficult to install retroactively, as the floor covering must be removed. They are most practical during new construction or during major remodeling projects. They are more effective at warming the floor surface \"to the touch,\" rather than heating the entire room. Radiant floor heating is less effective under carpeting, hardwood, or vinyl since heat can be trapped between the insulating surface layer and the subfloor.","prerequisiteComponentType":[],"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":10000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":4,"utilityType":0}
