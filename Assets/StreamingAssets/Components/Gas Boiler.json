{"componentName":"Gas Boiler","description":"Boilers are special-purpose water heaters. Boiler systems distribute the heat in hot water, which gives up heat as it passes through radiators or other devices in rooms throughout the house. The cooler water then returns to the boiler to be reheated. Hot water systems are often called hydronic systems.","pros":"Evenly distributes heat throughout a home, which is sometimes a complaint with forced air systems. Boiler heat is clean, meaning you don’t get all of the allergens and other particles blown throughout your home, along with the warm air – water heating systems are great if you’re after optimal indoor air quality. There is little routine maintenance required for boilers (i.e. no filters to change, etc.).","cons":"Often cost more to install than forced air systems because many homes need to be outfitted with the proper piping systems, etc. Replacement parts for boilers can be more expensive than those for forced air systems. You can’t cool your home with a boiler, which means that additional ductwork, etc. is required if you wish to install air conditioning. Can take longer to respond when the thermostat is changed.","prerequisiteComponentType":[],"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":50000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":2,"utilityType":1}
