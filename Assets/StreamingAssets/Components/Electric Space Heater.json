{"componentName":"Electric Space Heater","description":"Portable (plug-in) electric heaters are inexpensive to buy, but costly to use. These resistive heaters include “oil-filled” and “quartz-infrared” heaters. They convert electric current from the wall socket directly into heat, like a toaster or clothes iron.","pros":"Almost all of the electricity consumed by a space heater is converted to heat, so the units themselves are nearly 100% efficient. They are portable, so you can move them to the bedroom by night and the home office by day. Provide comfortable heat and it is easy to install. Practically no maintenance is required. Temperature controlled heating. No heat leakage and no pipework required.","cons":"Government regulations limit space heater output to 1,500 watts, which is not nearly enough to heat an entire home. In general, one square foot of space requires about 10 watts of electricity to heat, which means that a space heater operating at its maximum output can heat a room no larger than 150 square feet. Aside from that, electricity can be expensive depending on the area and a power cut can leave you without heating.","prerequisiteComponentType":[],"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":10000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":4,"utilityType":0}
