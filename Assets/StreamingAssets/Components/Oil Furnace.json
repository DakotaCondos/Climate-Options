{"componentName":"Oil Furnace","description":"Heating oil has been used since the 1920s and continues to be used because of the distinct advantages it provides as a heating fuel. An oil furnace is similar to a gas furnace, yet includes the added step of vaporizing the oil into a fine mist mixed with air. The oil/air fuel mixture is then used to ignite burners inside a combustion chamber. The generated heat then enters a heat exchanger, transferring heat to the air and raising the temperature of a space to the level set by a thermostat.","pros":"Initial installation price tends to be higher for oil furnaces, but they can make up for the cost with their durability and longevity: oil furnaces can last for 20-30 years compared to the 12-15 years expected of an electric furnace. Heating oil burns hotter than either gas or electricity and can often heat a building more quickly. Oil furnaces produce very little harmful byproducts. Unlike natural gas, heating oil is not flammable or explosive, making this type of furnace one of the safest options.","cons":"Modern oil-burning furnaces are not often quite as fuel-efficient as gas or electric furnaces. Annual heating bills can fluctuate depending on the price of oil products in a given year, which can make heating costs for an oil furnace more or less than gas or electric options.","prerequisiteComponentType":3,"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":50000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":1,"utilityType":2}
