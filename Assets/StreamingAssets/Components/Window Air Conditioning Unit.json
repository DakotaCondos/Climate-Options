{"componentName":"Window Air Conditioning Unit","description":"A popular type of cooling equipment designed to fit in windows. They’re commonly found in apartments that lack central air conditioning, or providing a cooling boost to single rooms in larger homes","pros":"Window air conditioning units are smaller, more portable, and easier to install than most other types of units. They are also the cheapest option for adding air conditioning to your home, especially if you’re working with a tight budget. Models manufactured today are up to 30 percent more efficient than those manufactured only a decade ago. And many come with warranties as long as five years, so you will have peace of mind when you make your purchase.","cons":"Always remember, window air conditioners aren’t meant to cool your entire home. Even if you live in an apartment, you’ll need multiple units to keep the entire apartment comfortable. Each unit you install takes up a window for the entire summer. You will also have to deal with loud compressors running in each room. If you decide to go with a larger unit, it may be awkward to install and remove. Factors may limit the efficiency of your window air conditioner, including high ceilings, numerous windows and doors, high sun exposure, or cooling a room on the top floor.","prerequisiteComponentType":[],"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":false,"isCooling":true,"heatingBTUOutput":0.0,"coolingBTUOutput":5000.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.0,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"componentType":5,"utilityType":0}
