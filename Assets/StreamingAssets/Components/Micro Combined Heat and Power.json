{"componentName":"Micro Combined Heat and Power","description":"Micro combined heat and power (micro-CHP) is a technology that generates heat and electricity simultaneously, from the same energy source, in individual homes or buildings. Micro-CHP systems are a similar size and shape to standard domestic boilers. They can be mounted on a wall or can stand on the floor. Domestic micro-CHP systems are usually powered by mains gas or liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and the technology is considered a low carbon technology because it can be more efficient than just burning fossil fuel for heat and getting electricity from the grid.","pros":"When the micro-CHP is generating heat, the unit will also generate electricity to be used in your home (or exported). Micro- CHP systems increase efficiency of fuel. Approximately 85% of the energy put into a system is used for either electrical power or heating and cooling purposes.Lastly, Micro-CHP systems allow you to cut your carbon footprint by generating electricity on-site. If you already have a conventional boiler, then a micro-CHP unit should be able to replace it, as it’s roughly the same size.","cons":"One major disadvantage of micro-CHP systems is the high initial costs of the equipment that make up the systems. A micro-CHP system will cost more than a traditional boiler. Aside from that, a micro-CHP system is not seen as a “true'' sustainable energy source (being predominantly fuelled by natural gas) unless it can be used with renewable fuels such as Biogas produced from AD plants, or Hydrogen mixture.","prerequisiteComponentType":[3],"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":25000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":1,"utilityType":1}
