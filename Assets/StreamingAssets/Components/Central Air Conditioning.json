{"componentName":"Central Air Conditioning","description":"This system is the best way to cool your entire home. Central Air distributes cooled air throughout ductwork with return and supply registers in each room. The air conditioning components are located outside, except for the air handler, which is typically shared with the furnace. If you have ductwork in place and are looking for whole-house cooling, this is the most popular system.","pros":"A central AC system is the most efficient way to keep your entire home cool. This system ensures that you lower energy bills and maintain indoor comfort with cooler temperatures and lower humidity. And with components located outside, you can keep cool with a nearly invisible, silent system. Central AC systems are also a valuable investment as a permanent fixture to your home.","cons":"Central air conditioning systems require annual maintenance to stay in top working condition for years to come. You should prepare for higher upfront costs, especially if you also need to install ductwork. However, replacing an existing central air unit is cheaper than installing a new ductless mini-split.\r\nThe final question is what size air conditioning system you need. If you choose a unit that is undersized, it won’t keep up on the hottest days. An oversized unit will short cycle, wearing out the parts faster even though the system can’t dehumidify your home.\r\n​","prerequisiteComponentType":3,"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":false,"isCooling":true,"heatingBTUOutput":0.0,"coolingBTUOutput":34000.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.0,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0000833235,"componentType":0,"utilityType":0}
