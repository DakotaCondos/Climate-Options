{"componentName":"Gas Furnace","description":"A gas furnace is a home heating appliance that runs off of natural gas. The natural gas is ignited in the furnace, warming up the air, which is then delivered throughout the home. Modern gas furnaces are among the most efficient ways to heat your home with Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiencies (AFUE) ratings reaching 98.5%","pros":"Natural gas is extremely reliable and it is less expensive than other fossil fuels. It also burns cleaner than other fossil fuels making it environmentally friendly and is safer and easier to store when compared to other fossil fuels. Lower fuel costs and improved energy efficiency make natural gas furnaces typically cheaper to run. Desired temperatures are reached faster than an electrically powered furnace, using significantly less fuel while heating-up.","cons":"A Natural gas furnace is generally more expensive upfront and may be more expensive to install if it requires plumbing into a supply line. The main disadvantage of natural gas furnaces is the generation of emissions.","prerequisiteComponentType":[3],"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":50000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":1,"utilityType":1}
