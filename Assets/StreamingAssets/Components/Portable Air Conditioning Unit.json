{"componentName":"Portable Air Conditioning Unit","description":"These units are similar to window air conditioners, but the unit sits on the floor instead of sitting in the window. Portable air conditioners draw in air, remove heat and moisture, and vents cool dry air into your home. The hot and humid air is vented out of your home through an exhaust host going out the window. This is only a superior option to window units if you have the wrong kind of windows or are worried about installing a window unit.","pros":"Portable units are even easier to install than window units. The floor unit rolls around on casters so you can quickly position or move it, and the hose leading out the window does not obstruct your view. Plus, the hose is easy to take out of the window temporarily when the weather is nice.","cons":"According to Consumer Reports, portable air conditioners usually only deliver half the cooling capacity they claim, leaving you feeling hot and sweaty even if the unit is running full bore. Theyâ€™re also typically more expensive and less efficient than similarly sized window units, which drives up purchasing and operating costs. Noise can be another factor, and most portable air conditioners have reservoirs that need to be manually drained as the unit removes humidity from the air.","prerequisiteComponentType":7,"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":false,"isCooling":true,"heatingBTUOutput":0.0,"coolingBTUOutput":5000.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.0,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"componentType":5,"utilityType":0}
