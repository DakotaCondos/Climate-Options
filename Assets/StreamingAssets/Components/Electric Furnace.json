{"componentName":"Electric Furnace","description":"An electric furnace is a type of heater that uses electric heat coils and a blower fan to evenly distribute heat throughout your home. An electric forced air furnace works in the same way as a hairdryer. The heat exchanger sucks air into the system and the electric heating chamber warms it up. The blower fan pushes out the hot air through the ductwork into your house.","pros":"A benefit to using an electric furnace over the other fuel types is that electric furnaces donâ€™t produce carbon monoxide. The lack of carbon monoxide production makes the system more environmentally friendly and easier to install. Electric furnaces are also 100 percent efficient, because all of the electricity used is put toward heating your home.","cons":"A major disadvantage to electric furnaces is the cost to run them. Electricity tends to be more expensive than gas in many regions. In some areas, electric furnaces are paired with heat pumps to allow for a greater savings in cost when compared to electricity alone.","prerequisiteComponentType":3,"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":100000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.000293,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":1,"utilityType":0}
