{"componentName":"Heat Pump","description":"A heat pump takes heat energy from one place and moves it to another by compressing and expanding refrigerant. A heat pump extracts heat from the air and transfers this heat to either the inside or outside of your home, depending on the season. A central heat pump distributes heat and cool air through ductwork connected to vents in each room.","pros":"One of the key advantages to an electric heat pump is the efficiency with which it operates; it will keep your home comfortable while keeping your energy bills down. Another advantage of an electric heat pump is humidity control; the heat pump doesn’t dry out the air when heating in the way that traditional gas heaters do. You probably won’t need to use a humidifier during the wintertime. Lastly, Gas furnaces in the home come with an inherent safety concern; you’ll always have to be aware of the possibility of a gas leak or even a fire or explosion that could occur. As they do not make use of natural gas, electric heat pumps do not have this issue and are generally safer in your home than gas furnaces.","cons":"While having an electric heat pump is likely to save you on energy costs in the long run, they’re not particularly cheap to install. Electric heat pumps do require more care and maintenance to keep them operating at maximum efficiency. Lastly, Electric Heat Pumps Are Larger Than Other Systems because an electric heat pump needs to have both an indoor and outdoor component.","prerequisiteComponentType":3,"isWholeHomeComponent":true,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":true,"heatingBTUOutput":75000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":75000.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.0001817,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0001833,"componentType":1,"utilityType":0,"priceLow":3800.0,"priceHigh":10000.0,"imagePath":""}
