{"componentName":"Wood Burning Stove","description":"Wood burning stoves are self-contained heating appliances designed to produce indoor heat through wood combustion. A wood fire is contained in the body of the stove, which is usually made of steel or cast iron. The fire warms the body of the stove, which radiates heat into the surrounding space. Smoke from the fire leaves the building through a pipe (called the flue) that leads to a chimney.","pros":"Wood stoves provide radiant heat, which means that these units give off powerful heat in all directions and can warm an area in your home faster and more efficiently than your home’s vent system. Wood is much more environmentally friendly when compared with the typical fossil fuels (oil and gas) you typically see in home heating units. With a few well-placed stoves, you can zone-heat any room or space and almost completely remove the need for a central heating system.","cons":"Regular use of your wood stove requires a never-ending supply of logs to fuel your fire. If you must purchase your cordwood, it cancels out the cost-efficiency of a wood stove. Additionally, depending on your location and the time of year, you can expect to pay more. Wood systems also require more space to store this bulky fuel. Wood stoves requires regular tending (at least twice a day) when they’re running full time. Many modern wood stoves have a catalytic combustor, which usually involves inspection three times a season. Additionally, you’ll need to schedule a chimney cleaning and inspection at least once a year to remove excess residue and soot to ensure safety.\r\n​","prerequisiteComponentType":[],"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":50000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.10000000149011612,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":4,"utilityType":3}
