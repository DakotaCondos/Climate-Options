{"componentName":"Gas Fired Space Heaters","description":"In some areas, gas-fired direct heating equipment is popular. This includes wall-mounted, free-standing, and floor furnaces, all characterized by their lack of ductwork and relatively small heat output. Because they lack ducts, they are most useful for warming a single room. If heating several rooms is required, either the doors between rooms must be left open or another heating method is necessary.","pros":"It is cheaper to run a gas heater than an electric one. Aside from this, gas heaters warm up the house quicker and produce warmer heat than other types of space heaters. If you do plan to use a gas-powered space heater inside, look for safety features such as a low oxygen sensor, high-temperature coated safety guard, overheat protection, and an automatic shut-off in case the device gets knocked over.","cons":"They rely on fuel thatâ€™s flammable and prone to the emission of harmful carbon dioxide. Aside from that, they need special venting to discharge combustion gasses and they have a shorter lifespan. It also requires a gas line and the installation is generally more complex. Lastly, it can cause a carbon monoxide leak.","prerequisiteComponentType":7,"isWholeHomeComponent":false,"isHeating":true,"isCooling":false,"heatingBTUOutput":30000.0,"coolingBTUOutput":0.0,"heatingCostPerBTU":0.00001,"coolingCostPerBTU":0.0,"componentType":4,"utilityType":1,"priceLow":200.0,"priceHigh":800.0,"imagePath":""}
