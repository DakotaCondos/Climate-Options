{"componentName":"Fireplace","description":"A fireplace is an open area built into the structure of a home where a fire can be safely contained to generate heat and to provide a relaxing atmosphere, while allowing waste gasses and smoke to leave the property via a chimney.","pros":"They donâ€™t require electricity because wood-burning fireplaces rely on using actual wood as their power source, your fireplace would still work even if the power goes out. This could be an effective backup source of heat and light in the event of an Iowa snowstorm, and it would even give you and your family a means to cook food if needed. A wood-burning fireplace is your best choice if you want the ambiance and authenticity of a crackling fire. While any fireplace can add a cozy, homey feel to a room, no other option can beat the atmosphere created by a traditional fireplace.","cons":"The authenticity of real wood logs also means that you have to have a supply of logs in order for your fireplace to work, and using your fireplace requires actually starting a fire yourself. Along with starting the fire, homeowners also have to regularly clean ashes out of their fireplace to prevent buildup.
